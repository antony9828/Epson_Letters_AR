# Epson_Letters_AR
This is a project for RTU MIREA

How it works

2 players need to create a word out of the mix of letters
the first letter gets highlighted for player 1
player 1 takes that letter and puts it in the "box" that has a marker
the second letter gets hightlighed for player 2
player 2 takes that letter and puts in in the "box" after the first letter
the proccess continues until the word is complete
